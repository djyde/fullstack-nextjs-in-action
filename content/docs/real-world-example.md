# Real world examples

We are going to build some real world examples step by step with the technique I metioned in previous sections. 

You can start from this repo: https://github.com/djyde/fullstack-nextjs-in-action-example

```
git clone https://github.com/djyde/fullstack-nextjs-in-action-example.git
```

In the `master` branch, is a base Next.js project that contains all the technique in I mentioned in previous sections. So you don't need to integrate them by yourself. 

But if you just want to read through the code, notice that I wrote down the corresponding commit hash for each section. You can simply run `git checkout xxx`  (`xxx` is the commit hash) to read the code step by step.
